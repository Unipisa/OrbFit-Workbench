# OrbFit Workbench

### This [OrbFit](https://github.com/Unipisa/SWHAPPE) workbench is for the acquisition of the source code of OrbFit, an astronomy library to compute orbits and ephemerides.

-------------------

This repository contains information on the acquisition process related to the OrbFit project that were created during the work.

The original finds are stored in the [Depository](https://github.com/Unipisa/OrbFit-Depository) containing the [raw materials](https://github.com/Unipisa/OrbFit-Depository/tree/master/raw_materials) and the [browsable source](https://github.com/Unipisa/OrbFit-Depository/tree/master/browsable_source).

The resulting 
[development history](https://github.com/Unipisa/OrbFit/tree/SourceCode/) can be found in the [OrbFit repository](https://github.com/Unipisa/OrbFit).

This repository was created with the support of the [Software Heritage Acquisition Process Pisa Enactor](https://github.com/Unipisa/SWHAPPE).  
Please look at the [SWHAPPE repository](https://github.com/Unipisa/SWHAPPE/README.md) and to the [guidelines](https://github.com/SoftwareHeritage/swhapguide/blob/master/SWHAP%40Pisa.pdf) for more details.
